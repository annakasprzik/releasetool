<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
If you are interested in the source code of the application,
please visit <a href="{{ url_sourcecode }}">the project's website</a>.
</p>

<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>
A prototype of the tool 
has been presented under the title
&quot;Towards Semantic Quality Control of Automatic Subject Indexing&quot;
at 
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1007/978-3-319-67008-9_56">TPDL-2017, Thessaloniki, Greece, September 18-21, 2017</a>
(Martin Toepfer &amp; Christin Seifert, 2017).
That predecessor used semantic web technology as a database backend.
By contrast to the prototype, the new releasetool has been reimplemented and revised 
substantially in several aspects.
Semantic web technology is now only accessed as a service to access the thesaurus.
The reimplementation has been performed in order to put more emphasize on business processes
and system integration.
</p>

<h2>Automatic Subject Indexing</h2>
<p>
The releasetool does not depend on a specific subject indexing method. 
However, the explanation functionality of the tool is particularly of interest when
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7991557/">fusion approaches</a>
are applied.
